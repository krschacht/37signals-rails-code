# Basecamp repo - Great Rails code

If you like to study well-written code in order to learn, there is no better repository to study for learning Rails than Basecamp and Hey. As you browse this repo, notice that files with ".rb" have content and files that end in "-rb" have no content. The empty files are placeholders to give you a sense for other models that exist.

The Basecamp code came primarily from a series of videos DHH did many years ago on [Writing Software Well](https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-writing-software-well/). Here are all the videos:

 Episode #7 - Move the specifics down as far as it'll go when evolving your codebase


This spirit of sharing was continued by Jorge Manrubia in a series of articles title [Code I Like](https://dev.37signals.com/series/code-i-like/). All of the Hey reference code came from Jorge's articles.

It's worth watching and reading all of the above, if you want to know more. But I've found it helpful to have all the code samples organized into a repo to help me piece together how the team thinks about the overall code organization and domain model.
